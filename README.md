get healthy restaurants  for runners
Intended as a demo to play with KD tree and R trees.  I was asked during an interview how to 
calculate distances within a radius and had no idea. So take every opportunity as a learning one.
This is designed as an excercse to to:
a) Play with the strava api
b) play with new data structures
